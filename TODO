--  Changed approach to problem 
	Now goal is to add input from user into a variable
	that stores something like 1x2 much like a real calculator
	once equals is pressed it divides string into first second and operand
	then returns output or when a second number is already provided
	then it does the same thing with equals being pressed 
	this way its much simpler and allows for greater flexability

[_] Make delete work && Clear
	this can be done simply by checking for delete button after every 
	button pressed in the calculator
[_] Take second number first
[_] Handle case like 12 *- 8 Where the original operand has to be 
	removed
[_] Fix numbers out of bound when numbers are more than 11 digits
	by adding a new line or something 

## Style
[_] Remove button borders
[_] Decide color to be added on hover or have a constant color
[_] Add the same for operand buttons
[_] Add corners for the calculator
[_] Adjust buttons width
[_] Final touches on apperance
[_] Adjust position for text in the screen
